            Overview
        </h3>
        <p>Being a huge fan of sneakers and understanding their history, I wanted to redesign the Nike Blazer page
            because they have so much significant history behind them! Give credit where credit is due is what I'm
            trying to go for this project.</p>
        <p>Nike has been releasing a steady amount of retro shoes within the last decade but lacks the intriguing
            promotion factor on the designated webpage. Unfortunately, you have to go in-depth to find the Nike Blazer,
            and it doesn't have any historical or significant information for the consumers to know about before
            purchasing.</p>

    <h3>Competitor Analysis</h3>
    <p>Nike's main competitor is Adidas, but the margin of revenue is significant. Compared to other companies, Nike
        seems like the brand most consumers would prefer since it is well recognized, and the quality is usually up to
        par. All the competitors shown offer the same products in terms of clothing and footwear, which is
        athletic/casual.</p>

        <p>Another competitor Nike has in terms of retro shoes is Puma; most of its shoes are designs are based on the
            retro
            and a relaxed look. Nike's value proposition consists of four values, accessibility, innovation,
            customization,
            and brand/status.</p>

        <p id="nike-top-paragraph">Initially, we envisioned that the app could address the needs of both novice and
            intermediate users. We also
            wanted to be inclusive of those who wanted to build a PC for reasons other than gaming (e.g., animation,
            development, etc.). After further consideration, the decision was made to focus on gamers. Narrowing the
            scope
            gave us a more precise direction and helped simplify UI decisions.</p>

                    <h3>Situation:</h3>
                    <p>Michael is a 17-year-old high school student who has been collecting sneakers for the last two
                        years; he prioritizes the historical value. To pay for this expensive hobby, he works a
                        part-time job as a cashier at the local supermarket.</p>

                    <h3>Problem:</h3>
                    <p>Since Michael prioritizes the historical value of the shoes, he finds it hard to find information
                        on his next purchase; the Nike Blazers. He prefers not to look through multiple sites to get the
                        insight he needs; instead, Michael wishes Nike has all the details he needs.</p>

                    <h3>Solution:</h3>
                    <p>Michael discovered Nike had redesigned their Nike Blazer page with more than enough information
                        regarding the Nike Blazer. This gives him the peace-of-mind when purchasing the sneaker and
                        putting it in his collection.</p>

        <h3 class="nike-userflow-title">Userflow</h3>
        <p>Even though the steps might seem like a simple revamp/redesign of the Nike Blazer page, it's always practical
            to include a user flow/task flow to better understand the impact of this project.</p>

        <p>Already having a base idea of what kind of layout I wanted, I jumped into Figma to create a wireframe to have
            a more solid visual representation.</p>
        <div class="nike-wireframe">
            <a data-fslightbox="" href="/wireframe1.ba3d4adf.png"><img src="/wireframe1.ba3d4adf.png" alt="wireframe"></a>

        </div>
    </div>
</div>

<div class="takeaway-container">
    <h1>3. Deliver</h1>
    <p>With the wireframes done and research on designing the prototype, I created my design. I wanted to involve the
        past and the present with this design; as you can see, the images have a large black border around them and
        using a solid shadow effect created an emphasis, which was popular during the 1990s to 2000s. With the "Nike
        Blazer" text on the home page, it was also popular back then, but I wanted to modernize it by created a double
        layer with an opacity, which makes it seem like it's part of the background but emphasis the "Nike Blazer"
        title.</p>

    <h3>Next Steps</h3>
    <p>As I only had two weeks to work on this project, I decided to present this work; however, I want to continue to
        work on it. The Next Step would be to inspire other Nike retros shoes that don't get enough exposure that they
        deserve.</p>
