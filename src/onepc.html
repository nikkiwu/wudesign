        <p>I enrolled as a full-time UX/UI Design student at Emily Carr, and we were asked to create a mobile app within
            five weeks.</p>
        <p>Building a PC doesn’t have to be overwhelming. 1PC is a clear, reliable, one-stop guide for beginners to
            build their optimal gaming system. Parts are recommended based on their needs and budget, and tutorials help
            them through every step of assembly. As a Progressive Web App (PWA), information is always up-to-date, and
            it’ s available on any platform.</p>

        <h1>“How to build a PC” Google search results SOARED in 2020.</h1>
        <h1 class="why-emphasis">Why?</h1>
    </div>
    <p>Users building their PCs has grown in popularity since 2020 due to increasingly more time spent at home engaging
        in activities like gaming. For gamers, PCs are often seen as the superior platform (compared to consoles),
        allowing individuals to determine what degree of performance suits their budget.</p>
    <p>The price range of builds varies greatly, but people tend to be motivated to build their PC (versus buying
        pre-built) to maximize value. The system as a whole can be seen as an investment due to its modularity. However,
        aside from price, one obstacle is the degree of specialized knowledge required to obtain parts and assemble the
        system. Nevertheless, PC building can be a fun and rewarding DIY project.</p>
</div>

        <h1>“I’m new...building a PC seems too hard”</h1>
        <h1 class="think-again">THINK AGAIN.</h1>
    </div>
    <p>Initially, we envisioned that the app could address the needs of both novice and intermediate users. We also
        wanted to be inclusive of those who wanted to build a PC for reasons other than gaming (e.g., animation,
        development, etc.). After further consideration, the decision was made to focus on gamers. Narrowing the scope
        gave us a more precise direction and helped simplify UI decisions.</p>
    <div class="persona-img-text">
        <a data-fslightbox href="assets/images/1pc/persona.jpg"><img src="assets/images/1pc/persona.jpg" alt="persona"></a>
        <p>This user has likely owned several gaming consoles spanning generations, is tapped into the gaming community
            and is interested in consumer technology. That said, we consider them novice in some respects, as they have
            little specialized knowledge regarding the parts and process.</p>
    </div>
    <p>We surveyed several respondents in the 25-35 age bracket who are interested in gaming (or are at least active
        computer users) and developed a persona. The persona is confident and motivated enough to attempt a DIY project,
        and their primary motivator is maximizing value. Despite overall willingness, they still feel overwhelmed by the
        amount of decentralized information.</p>

        <p>Most people currently piece together information from PCPartPicker/YouTube/Reddit, but this does not address
            the overall need for a single truth source. Existing mobile apps, such as BuildCores, were focused on
            acquiring the PC parts but did not offer recommendations or an educational component.</p>

            <p>This journey map illustrates the emotional roller-coaster of building a PC from start to finish with the
                resources available today. The user is burdened with finding a current build, learning about each
                component, weighing opinions and options, budget creep, and an intimidating installation phase. So how
                might a solution address these concerns?</p>

        <p>Our app is a one-stop guide that suggests a build (a complete list of compatible parts that can be assembled

        <p><b>1 -</b> The build suggestion algorithm takes the guesswork out of compatibility. You know the parts
            listed will work together and fit in the case.</p>
        <p><b>2 -</b> The app provides realistic, practical estimates (eg, FPS) of your system’s performance in relation
            to the games you pre-selected.</p>
        <p><b>3 -</b> If you want to upgrade a part, hitting the corresponding button will find a higher-end part
            (represented by the flame icons). If possible, the budget will be reallocated to accommodate the costs.</p>
        <p><b>4 -</b> Multimedia tutorials (diagrams, videos, transcripts) for installing your specific build are
            provided.</p>
        <h1>Revamp; Simplify</h1>
        <p>Our onboarding screens give the user an idea of what to expect from the app and reassures them that it is a
            simple, guided process that caters to beginners. Accounts are necessary so that builds can be saved and
            purchase shipments can be tracked.</p>
        <p>Two simple questions are presented to the user when they initiate a build: <b>what games do you play</b> and
            <b>what is your budget</b>? The games chosen will define the performance target. The budget can be firm, or
            adjusted as
            needed in the later steps.
        </p>
        <p>Installation will not only cover assembling the physical parts, but also installing the operating system and

        <p>Using a low-fidelity prototype that largely resembled the wireframes, users were tasked with reaching the
            suggested build screen and buying one of the parts. Though the testers completed the tasks, some points of
            friction were noted.</p>
        <p>The primary calls-to-action resulted in hesitation, such as “Start New Build” and “Install.” The
            unfamiliarity of the “build” concept made testers uncertain about the result. Explanations provided in the
            on-boarding were forgotten during actual usage of the app.</p>
        <p>Information-dense pages such as the suggested build page were seen as too scattered and redundant.
            Furthermore, the method of upgrading parts at this point was not yet precise.</p>

    <h1>Takeaways</h1>
    <ul>
        <li><p><b>Scope - </b>Initially, we wanted the app to appeal to anyone seeking a high-performance PC, but
            narrowing the scope to gamers was not just a necessity due to constraints; it helped us creatively focus. We
            were able to target that segment with our content/imagery and limit the feature set to what would best serve
            and inform them.</p></li>
        <li><p><b>Repetition - </b>Through testing, we determined that information provided during onboarding was not
            enough to fully prepare or orient the user, due to the unfamiliarity of some concepts. Reiterating
            information with preamble, label, and tooltip text whenever possible helped make the app content more
            coherent.</p></li>
        <li><p><b>Content - </b>Our biggest challenge was organizing our information to educate while actively guiding
            the user. The goal was to inform the user what (for instance) a GPU does, beyond just listing it as a
            necessary part. In doing so, the user would feel more confident in their choices and understand their system
            on a more fundamental level.</p></li>
        <li><p><b>Real World Usage -</b>Although testing was done in stages and in a theoretical sense, our next
            essential step is to have a user actually build a PC using our method and note the points where they
            experience difficulty. That said, this test will be a significant undertaking in terms of time and finances,
            so we are unable to plan for this until we find a suitable opportunity and participant.</p></li>
